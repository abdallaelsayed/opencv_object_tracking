This project is the solution to the problem statement mentioned in the wiki of this project repository.

The sample video for testing the program can be downloaded from here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t40lp3qphao7dfy/kCCnYSo_Zl#f:Video%2095.mp4 .

The solution is not very polished and need more work. But given the time limit and effort to solve the problem is satisfactory.

This project needs "openCV library" to be installed in the OS. This project was development on MacOS platform. The program is written in c++. Thus, a cpp library need to be installed too.

The program needs little bit of user interaction. The instructions to run this program is given in the cpp source file i.e template_track.cpp.

When you successfully compiled and created executable, then please switch between 

method=CV_TM_CCOEFF or method=CV_TM_CCOEFF_NORMED

which will help program track the object i.e turtle.

Incase, you have some doubt and need to clarify it then please contact me on "mailto:ankitsingh.05@gmail.com".

Thank you.
